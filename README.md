# Simulated Annealing
Simulated annealing is a meta-heuristic algorithm that optimize a function, the algorithm doesn't guarantees the global optimum, but it's very practical at some situation when the problem it's really hard and a decent solution is needed.
## Run the code
```
make && sh exec.sh
```
